        <p class="titreArticle">Integrating cellular senescence with the concept of damage accumulation in aging: Relevance for clearance of senescent cells</p><a href="http://localhost:8000/article/articleMitochondrie.php">Understanding the aging process and ways to manipulate it is of major importance for biology and medicine. Among the many aging theories advanced over the years, the concept most consistent with experimental evidence posits the buildup of numerous forms of molecular damage as a foundation of the aging process. Here, we discuss that this concept integrates well with recent findings on cellular senescence, offering a novel view on the role of senescence in aging and age‐related disease. </a>

        <p class="titreArticle">MicroRNA Regulation of Oxidative Stress-Induced Cellular Senescence</p><a>Aging is a time-related process of functional deterioration at cellular, tissue, organelle, and organismal level that ultimately brings life to end. Cellular senescence, a state of permanent cell growth arrest in response to cellular stress, is believed to be the driver of the aging process and age-related disorders. The free radical theory of aging, referred to as oxidative stress (OS) theory below, is one of the most studied aging promoting mechanisms.</a>

        <p class="titreArticle">Integrin Beta 3 Regulates Cellular Senescence by Activating the TGF-β Pathway</p><a>Cellular senescence is an important in vivo mechanism that prevents the propagation of damaged cells. However, the precise mechanisms regulating senescence are not well characterized. Here, we find that ITGB3 (integrin beta 3 or β3) is regulated by the Polycomb protein CBX7. β3 expression accelerates the onset of senescence in human primary fibroblasts by activating the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway in a cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manner. β3 levels are dynamically increased during oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) through CBX7 Polycomb regulation, and downregulation of β3 levels overrides OIS and therapy-induced senescence (TIS), independently of its ligand-binding activity.</a>

        <p class="titreArticle">Cellular Senescence: A Translational Perspective</p><a>Cellular senescence entails essentially irreversible replicative arrest, apoptosis resistance, and frequently acquisition of a pro-inflammatory, tissue-destructive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues with aging and at sites of pathogenesis in many chronic diseases and conditions. The SASP can contribute to senescence-related inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, stem cell dysfunction, aging phenotypes, chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes, and loss of resilience. Delaying senescent cell accumulation or reducing senescent cell burden is associated with delay, prevention, or alleviation of multiple senescence-associated conditions.</a>

        <p class="titreArticle">Ageing, Cellular Senescence and Neurodegenerative Disease</p><a>Ageing is a major risk factor for developing many neurodegenerative diseases. Cellular senescence is a homeostatic biological process that has a key role in driving ageing. There is evidence that senescent cells accumulate in the nervous system with ageing and neurodegenerative disease and may predispose a person to the appearance of a neurodegenerative condition or may aggravate its course. Research into senescence has long been hindered by its variable and cell-type specific features and the lack of a universal marker to unequivocally detect senescent cells. Recent advances in senescence markers and genetically modified animal models have boosted our knowledge on the role of cellular senescence in ageing and age-related disease. </a>
